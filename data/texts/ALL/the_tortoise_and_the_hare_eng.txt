Once upon a time, there was a Hare who was very boastful that he was the fastest animal in the forest.
He was always showing off how fast he was to the other animals.
...and every morning, when he passed by the Tortoise, he would laugh at her, saying:
—Not so fast, you'll wear yourself out! Ha, ha, ha.
One day, the Tortoise answered:
—What would you wager that I could beat you in a race?
—Me? —said the Hare, laughing all the while. —I'd wager a sack full of carrots.
—I accept! —answered the Tortoise.
The following morning, all the animals were present, ready for the start of the race.
—Ready! Set!...
—Go! —said the Fox.
The Hare was off like a shot as soon as he heard the signal.
In no time at all, he was already halfway through the race... and he had an idea.
"If I stop here, I'll see the Tortoise come past and I can laugh at her".
And so just like that, the Hare stretched out under a tree to wait, and there he fell asleep.
After a while, slowly but surely, the Tortoise overtook the Hare, who was sleeping peacefully.
Shortly afterwards, the Hare woke up and...
Surprise! The Tortoise was already close to the finishing line.
The Hare ran as fast as he could but it was too late. The Tortoise finished first.
All the animals clapped.
She had won the race.
The Hare, humiliated, handed over the sack of carrots he had promised.
The Tortoise showed her appreciation for their support by sharing the carrots with all the other animals.
—Thank you, friends! Thank you!
And here our story ends.
